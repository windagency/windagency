## I am Damien TIVELET

- Lead Developer & Middle Manager at [Kaliop France](https://www.kaliop.com)

Developer specialized in web and mobile, originally from Vichy (France 03) and currently based in Edinburgh (Scotland), I like innovative challenges in terms of research and technological advances. I previously lived from 2010 to 2023 in Montpellier (France 34).

After almost 20 years of experience in development, including 2 years in a web agency, 9 years as a freelancer, 3 years as a trainer, 3 years in multinational ESN and various missions, I am as much at ease in front-end as in back-end and mobile, with a clear preference for React.js / React Native and Node.js, and a strong interest in Flutter.
