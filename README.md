## I'm Damien TIVELET

### Lead Software Engineer at [Qodea](https://www.qodea.com), a Google Cloud Technology Partner

I'm a developer specialising in web and mobile development. I'm originally from Vichy (France 03) and currently based in Edinburgh (Scotland). I previously lived in Montpellier (France 34) from 2010 to 2023. I like innovative challenges in terms of research and technological advances.

After almost 20 years of experience in development, including 2 years in a web agency, 9 years as a freelancer, 3 years as a trainer, 3 years in multinational ESN and various missions, I am as much at ease in front-end as in back-end and mobile, with a clear preference for React.js / React Native and Node.js and a strong interest in Flutter.

For several years now, I've been working as a lead developer, carrying out several tasks, such as guaranteeing the technical quality of projects, ensuring observability, advising on the definition of roadmaps, providing technical support to customers within an Agile framework, ensuring a balance between technical quality and product vision, designing and implementing complex functionalities, reusing and industrializing within projects, and supporting and enhancing the skills of the technical team.
