## 🚀 I Build Scalable Systems. I Orchestrate AI. I Elevate Engineering.

With nearly **20 years of experience in software engineering**, I’ve operated across startups, freelance missions (9 years), technical training (3 years), and multinational ESNs.  
Today, as a **Lead Software Engineer**, I focus on building **high-quality, scalable, observable systems** that align technology with product vision.

I am as comfortable architecting complex backend systems as I am designing refined frontend experiences and mobile applications.

Cloud-native & observability-first mindset

But frameworks are tools.  
My real strength is **designing systems, processes, and teams that scale.**

## 🧠 What I Bring as a Lead Engineer

<table style="border:none; width:100%;">
<tr valign="top">
<td style="width: 50%;">

I don’t just build features. I design sustainable delivery systems.  
I go beyond implementation. I operate at the intersection of:

- Technical Excellence
- Product Strategy
- Delivery Optimisation

</td>
<td style="width: 50%;">

I:

- Guarantee architectural consistency & technical quality
- Design observability and resilience into systems
- Align engineering with product vision and roadmap strategy
- Provide technical leadership within Agile environments
- Balance long-term maintainability with short-term velocity
- Industrialise reusable components and foundations
- Support and elevate engineering teams
- Design and implement complex, high-impact features

</td>

I operate where **technology meets strategic impact**.

## 🤖 AI-Driven Development & Engineering Amplification

I am actively shaping the transition toward AI-augmented engineering.  
My focus includes:

- AI-Driven Dev (AIDD)
- BMAD methodologies
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Advanced prompting strategies
- Human-in-the-Loop AI systems

> I believe the future of software development is not about replacing developers.
> It’s about **amplifying their capabilities through intelligent collaboration**.

### ⚙️ VALORA — AI Orchestration for Real Software Delivery

I created **[VALORA](https://github.com/windagency/valora.ai)**, an open-source command-line AI orchestration tool designed to transform how teams deliver software.  
Most AI tools help you write code.  
**VALORA helps you ship software**.
